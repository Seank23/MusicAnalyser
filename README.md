# Music Analyser

Music Analyser is an application designed to provide a technical analysis of the musical elements present in an audio track. Through the use of audio processing and DSP, key technical features of the music - the notes, chords and key signature - are extracted in real-time and displayed intuitively to the user. While the analysis produced is not guaranteed to be completely accurate, Music Analyser aims to serve as a tool to help musicians and music enthusiasts in their quest to transcribe or to better understand a piece of music.
